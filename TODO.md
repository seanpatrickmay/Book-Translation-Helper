Given a pdf of a book, I want to have a tool that translate the page, and allows the user to hover over certain words to translate.

It should work in the following manner:
1. Run the pdf through the tool
    1.1. Separate the book into sentences
    1.2. Each sentence should be translated, and data stored
2. Book viewer tool, when you hover over a sentence it translates it
